## üîß Customization

### Adding New Legal Sections
Edit the `LEGAL_DATA` object in `script.js`:

```javascript
const LEGAL_DATA = {
  "your_act": {
    "name": "Your Act Name",
    "sections": {
      "123": {
        "title": "Section Title",
        "description": "Section description",
        "keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2"]
      }
    }
  }
};
```
